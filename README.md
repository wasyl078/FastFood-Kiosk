# :pizza: FastFood-Kiosk ![Open Source Love](https://badges.frapsoft.com/os/mit/mit.svg?v=102) ![my badge](https://img.shields.io/badge/status-finished-brightgreen) 
This is a small, but detailed, project for kiosk / interactive panel for restaurant. We can find big screens in every McDonald's or KFC and make an order. My implementation is not so *beautiful*, but it can be also be used by system administrator. Standard user is able to make an order and "pay" for it. A user with secret password can check supplies status in warehouse.
## Technologies and algorithms 
I used Java 8 with Swing library
## How to experience this project :hamburger:
Use computer mouse to choose options.
Super secret password for Administrator is: *password*

### Credits:
Thanks to one of my teacher, who asked us (us =  my group) to make individual projects like this, which was supposed it imitate a part of real live.  Without that I would not even come up with such an idea
